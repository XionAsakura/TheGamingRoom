# Reflection - Software Design for The Gaming Room

Client Summary:
The client, The Gaming Room, requested a web-based version of their existing Android game Draw It or Lose It. The game involves team-based guessing with rounds and a timed format. The client requested that the game be supported by multiple platforms, enforced unique names for teams and games, and limit it to a single instance of the gaming running at a time.

Reflection:
One aspect I believe I executed particularly well in this project was following the provided UML diagrams and expanding on them, as some key information was initially omitted. I was able to clearly define relationships between the Game, Team, and Player classes, which helped me understand the full system and allowed for a smoother coding process. Working through the design document early on gave me the opportunity to evaluate various operating systems and architectural types and expand on this knowledge as we progressed through the project. It also pushed me to carefully consider user needs and client requirements during the development process.

If I were to revisit this project, I would focus on enhancing the Evaluation section with stronger data to better support the architectural choices and recommendations made later in the document. Regardless, this experience has helped solidify my approach to software designâ€”starting from user requirements, visualizing system relationships through UML diagrams, and layering in architectural and security considerations. In the future, I plan to continue using this structured, user-centered design strategy while also incorporating additional methods to ensure that my recommendations are both strategic and evidence-based.
